# Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
# such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or
# equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
# to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x
# can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear
# between the left and right partitions.

# Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8


# Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list,

# EXAMPLE
# Input:(7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).Thatis,617 + 295. Output:2 -> 1 -> 9.Thatis,912.
# FOLLOW UP
# Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem. EXAMPLE
# lnput:(6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295. Output:9 -> 1 -> 2.Thatis,912.
